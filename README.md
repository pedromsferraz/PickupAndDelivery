# Use of Online Algorithms and Mixed Integer Programming in Pickup and Delivery Problems
This project was developed as my Undergraduate Thesis at PUC-Rio under the supervision of Professor Marco Molinaro. 

This project's main objective was the implementation and experimentation of Online Algorithms for solving Pickup and Delivery problems. Based on the analysis of the results of two algorithms recently proposed in literature, three new online algorithms were developed. The new algorithms were implemented and analyzed on existing databases and synthetic instances, showing superior results to the previous ones. In addition, the offline version of the problem was explored through the use of both brute force search and Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) methods.
